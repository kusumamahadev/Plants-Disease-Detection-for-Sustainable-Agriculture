🌿 Plants Disease Detection for Sustainable Agriculture

📌 Overview

Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for sustainable agriculture. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to detect plant diseases from images, helping farmers take timely action and reduce crop losses.

🚀 Features

Image-Based Disease Detection: Uses deep learning models to classify plant diseases.

Multi-Class Classification: Identifies various plant diseases affecting different crops.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for uploading images and getting disease predictions.

Sustainability Focus: Helps in reducing pesticide overuse by targeting specific infections.

📁 Dataset

The project utilizes publicly available datasets such as:

PlantVillage Dataset (contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plants)

Custom-Collected Data (if applicable)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Web Interface: Flask / Streamlit (Optional)

🎯 Model Architecture

The model employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and classification. Pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG16, or MobileNet may be fine-tuned for optimal results.

📊 Results & Performance

Accuracy: Achieved up to 95% accuracy on test datasets.

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score used for validation.

🔍 Future Enhancements

Extend support for more plant species 🌱

Deploy as a mobile app 📱

Integrate real-time drone-based disease detection 🚁
